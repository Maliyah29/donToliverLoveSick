The song "Let Her Go" by Don Toliver is my favorite from the album because it talks about letting someone go that you love. In reality, that is the opposite of what you'd want to do with a person that you hold close to your heart. At times though, sometimes the person you love more than yourself is the worst for you. And it is best to leave the siutation and love them from a distance.
